As our hero, Frank Fallen,
approaches the beautiful
woman he has this feeling 
like he knows her already. 
             Strange Woman:
                 "Hello"


Frank:
"Um, hi"


             Strange Woman:
     "We don't have much
     time I need you to come
     with me."
Frank(smiling):
"Okay, no problem."


             Strange Woman:
     "I have to warn you that
     there is no guarantee you
     will ever be able to...
             Strange Woman:
     come back to this place
     again."
      
Frank:
"That is okay I don't really
like shopping that much
anyway."
             Strange Woman:
     "No, I mean this world",
     she says sympathetically.
     "There is no time to...
             Strange Woman:
     explain but you must
     come with me."
     
Frank:
"I should have known there 
would be something.  You 
just seemed too pefect!"
             Strange Woman:
     "Yes of course you are
     going to think I am 
     crazy."
The strange woman opens
up the door behind her.


             Strange Woman:
     "Take a look at this!"
     

Behind the open door there
is something that looks like
it is out of a sci-fi movie.
It is like looking into a
huge painting of many 
different worlds with
creatures, plants, and who
knows what else constantly
moving and changing.



Frank(sarcastically):
"That is a nice trick, you 
must be a computer 
programmer to come up...
Frank:
with something like that.
Give me one good reason
to follow you anywhere...
Frank:
let alone into a...
screensaver."

             Strange Woman:
     "Your parents sent me
     to get you.  They are
     in trouble and you...
             Strange Woman:
     are the only one that
     can save them but we
     have to leave now!"
Frank is in shock.  How 
could his parents be asking
for help.  They died when 
he was a small boy.  In fact
he doesn't even remember
them at all and spent his life
being raised in foster homes
and orphanages.  He looks 
into the mysterious woman's 
eyes and sees something
that makes him believe that 
she is incapable of lying.
Without knowing why or
even realizing he is doing
it, he takes her hand and
<<<<<<< HEAD
follows her through the door.

follows her through the door.
             Enemy:
      You have no idea what
      you are getting into
      my advice, walk away.
