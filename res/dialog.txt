As our hero, Frank Fallen,
approaches the beautiful
woman he has this feeling 
like he knows her already. 
             Strange Woman:
                 "Hello"


Frank:
"Um, hi"


             Strange Woman:
     "We don't have much
     time I need you to come
     with me."
Frank(smiling):
"Okay, no problem."


             Strange Woman:
     "I have to warn you that
     there is no guarantee you
     will ever be able to...
             Strange Woman:
     come back to this place
     again."
      
Frank:
"That is okay I don't really
like shopping that much
anyway."
             Strange Woman:
     "No, I mean this world",
     she says sympathetically.
     "There is no time to...
             Strange Woman:
     explain but you must
     come with me."
     
Frank:
"I should have known there 
would be something.  You 
just seemed too pefect!"
             Strange Woman:
     "Yes of course you are
     going to think I am 
     crazy."
The strange woman opens
up the door behind her.


             Strange Woman:
     "Take a look at this!"
     

Behind the open door there
is something that looks like
it is out of a sci-fi movie.
It is like looking into a
huge painting of many 
different worlds with
creatures, plants, and who
knows what else constantly
moving and changing.



Frank(sarcastically):
"That is a nice trick, you 
must be a computer 
programmer to come up...
Frank:
with something like that.
Give me one good reason
to follow you anywhere...
Frank:
let alone into a...
screensaver."

             Strange Woman:
     "Your parents sent me
     to get you.  They are
     in trouble and you...
             Strange Woman:
     are the only one that
     can save them but we
     have to leave now!"
Frank is in shock.  How 
could his parents be asking
for help.  They died when 
he was a small boy.  In fact
he doesn't even remember
them at all and spent his life
being raised in foster homes
and orphanages.  He looks 
into the mysterious woman's 
eyes and sees something
that makes him believe that 
she is incapable of lying.
Without knowing why or
even realizing he is doing
it, he takes her hand and
follows her through the door.
             Enemy:
      You have no idea what
      you are getting into
      my advice, walk away.
As you enter the portal it
feels like your brain is on 
fire and you suddenly know
everything in the world.
It seems to be too much
as you find yourself
slowly slipping into 
unconsciousness.




You awaken to find yourself
in what seems like a cave.  
All around you see glowing
stones in the wall so you 
can see perfectly well.
Then the memories come
back and you can't believe
that you went through the 
portal. You don't see the 
strange woman anywhere 
so you decide that you are 
going to go look for her.




				Strange Woman:
	"You found me.  I was 
	worried	that I had lost
	you."	
Frank:
"What is this place?"


				Strange Woman:
	"It is the realm of the 
	burned out sun.  This place
	use to be a lot like earth
	until thousands of years
	ago it was hit by a huge 
	astroid and although 
	everyone was prepared and 
	underground for the impact 
	the planet was shifted 
	closer to their sun and it
	burned the surface of the
	planet so they have all had
	to live underground ever
	since.  We are in their 
	tunnels and some of them
	will not be happy to see us."
Frank:
"This just seems too impossible.
I am dreaming right?  You hit 
me in the head and I am laying
there drooling all over myself
right now huh?


				Strange woman:
	"I am afraid now.  since we
	are going to be together for
	a while, please call me Jen."
Frank:
"That sounds like a normal name
to me."

					Jen:
	"That is not my real name.
	As a human you do not posses
	the proper speaking organs
	to say my actual name but
	I like Jen so can me that."
	
	
Frank:
"Okay, Jen.  Now what?


					Jen:
	"This is not where we need
	to go so we should find the
	portal and get out of here
	before the locals get upset
	and do something that neither
	of us is going to like."
